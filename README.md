# SearchAndRescue34

## How do I start playing?
To start playing, you need to write the command /startsr <id> and specify the ID of the player who will be the target. (For now, only one player is possible) After all players on the server will be given a random weapon and ped cop. They will spawn in the sky with a parachute. (All cars will be spawned at Bulingbrook prison. Cars will be spawned as many as the number of players). After that an area will appear on the map and it will be narrowed every 5 minutes. If a player leaves the zone, he will be instantly killed. The police will win when they kill the target.
